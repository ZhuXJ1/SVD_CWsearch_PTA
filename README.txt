This repository includes MATLAB codes to perform searches for continuous gravitational waves  emitted by supermassive black hole binaries in circular orbits.
The paper that describes the method and its applications is:     Zhu et al. 2016, MNRAS, 461, 1317, "Detection and localization of continuous gravitational waves with pulsar timing arrays: the role of pulsar terms" (http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.461.1317Z)
